        <h1>Terms of Service</h1>
        <p>Price will be agreed upon and PAID to my PayPal BEFORE I start any work on your commission.
        <br>I am obligated to fulfill your commission to completion, however I reserve the right to cancel a commission in progress for any reason(s). Refunds MAY be issued where the reason is out of either my own or your control, at my own discretion.
        <br>You are responsible for purchasing a license to own and use any avatar bases that may be used in the creation of these avatars. I take no responsibility for avatar ownership other than my own.
        <br>While the commission is in progress, I reserve the right to stick to the agreed upon arrangements (however small adjustments can be made at my own discretion).
        <br>When the commission has been finished, I will send you a .unityproject file. I will assist you, if needed, in the uploading of your avatar via a screen-sharing call on Discord where I will guide you through selecting/installing the correct unity version and uploading the avatar to the VRchat servers.
        <br>You are allowed to modify the project as you please after I have sent it to you.
        <br>Public/modified versions of your avatar may be uploaded with a watermark as a means of advertising my business. Your version will not have any watermarks or signatures.
        <br>Due to the nature of this kind of work, I would advise against quest-only users from taking commissions as I am not able to test the avatar in such an environment. I can however provide quest-compatible versions of your avatar, should you agree upon it at the time of payment.
        <br>NSFW commissions are available, just ask.</p>
